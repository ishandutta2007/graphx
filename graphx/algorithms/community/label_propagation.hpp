    /** Returns communities in `G` as detected by asynchronous label
    propagation.

    The asynchronous label propagation algorithm is described in
    [1]_. The algorithm is probabilistic and the found communities may
    vary on different executions.

    The algorithm proceeds as follows. After initializing each node with
    a unique label, the algorithm repeatedly sets the label of a node to
    be the label that appears most frequently among that nodes
    neighbors. The algorithm halts when each node has the label that
    appears most frequently among its neighbors. The algorithm is
    asynchronous because each node is updated without waiting for
    updates on the remaining nodes.

    This generalized version of the algorithm in [1]_ accepts edge
    weights.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : Graph

    weight : string
        The edge attribute representing the weight of an edge.
        If None, each edge is assumed to have weight one. In this
        algorithm, the weight of an edge is used in determining the
        frequency with which a label appears among the neighbors of a
        node: a higher weight means the label appears more often.

    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default);
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

    Returns
    -------
    communities : iterable
        Iterable of communities given as sets of nodes.

    Notes
    -----
    Edge weight attributes must be numerical.
